  #### Get Link Communities
  
  # We get lc, an object of class linkcomm, which is a list containing the following components:
  # * numbers. An integer vector with the number of edges, nodes, and communities.
  # * hclust. An object of class hclust, which contains information about the hierarchical  clustering of links.
  # * pdmax. A numerical value indicating the height of the dendrogram at which the partition density is maximised.
  # * pdens. A numerical matrix with 2 columns; the first is the heights at which clusters  appear and the second is the partition density.
  # * nodeclusters. A data frame consisting of 2 columns; the first contains node names, and the second contains single community IDs for each node. All communities and their nodes are represented, but not necessarily all nodes.
  # * clusters. A list of integer vectors containing the link IDs that belong to each community. Community IDs are the numerical position of the communities in the list.
  # * edges. A data frame with 3 columns; the first two contain nodes that interact with each other, and the third is an integer vector of community IDs indicating community membership for each link.
  # * numclusters. A named integer vector. Names are node names and integer values are the number of communities to which each node belongs.
  # * clustsizes. A named integer vector. Names are community IDs and integer values indicate the number of nodes that belong in each community.
  # * igraph. An object of class igraph. The network is represented here as an igraph object.
  # * edgelist. A character matrix with 2 columns containing the nodes that interact with each other.
  # * directed. Logical indicating whether the network is directed.
  # * bipartite. Logical indicating whether the network is bi-partite.
